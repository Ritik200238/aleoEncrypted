## ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue**: "Invalid public balance" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you requested testnet credits from faucet (Step 1)

**Issue**: "Program already exists" error
- **Solution**: Great! Someone already deployed it. You can skip deployment or use a different program name.

**Issue**: Deployment takes > 2 minutes
- **Solution**: Normal! ZK proof generation can take time. Wait up to 5 minutes.

**Issue**: Transaction shows "Pending"
- **Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes, refresh explorer page. Testnet can be slow.
